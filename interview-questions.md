# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is a function? Why would you use one?

  Your answer: A function is a re-usable block of code, you would use it when you want your code to perform an action like return something or do a math problem etc. Functions are what give websites, apps, etc functionality. Functions make it so that these interfaces are interactable and can do things for the user.

  Researched answer: Functions are reusable pieces of code that only execute when invoked and always return an output. You can pass a function an argument that gets passed to its parameter and affect the code. By design functions are meant to be used repeatedly. There are different ways to make a function but in general functions consist of a variable declaration, a name, a parameter, curly braces where the actual code to be enacted goes, and a return.  Functions can be invoked throughout the code to perform it's intended task to make the overral code perform as expected, instead of having to rewrite code. 



2. In regards to functions, what is the difference between an argument and a parameter?

  Your answer: The difference between an parameter and an argument is that the parameter is the data that is expected to be passed to the function and the argument is the actual data that is passed by the user or whoever when the function is invoked/called. When a function is called inside the () braces is where the argument is inputted to be passed to the parameter that's in the layout of the function and from there the function will take that information into consideration when the code is executed. 

  Researched answer: Function logic should always be encapsulated meaning that the logic inside of your function can't reference other information inside your program and that's where arguments come in and solve that limitation. Arguments are outside information passed into the function via the parameter. Parameters and arguments are used to expand the functionality of a function instead of it being static this makes it more dynamic. The argument can be changed willingly and as many times as you want to get a different output from the function after it is passed to the parameter. Arguments can be used as edge cases to test for errors inside our codes logic, such as in conditionals an argument can be used to see how code responds to unexpected inputs. A function can have multiple parameters and multiple arguments passed to it.
